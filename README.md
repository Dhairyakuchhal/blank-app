# **Usage**
1. **Input Your Information**:
    - Enter your **Kerberos ID** (preferred) or **Full Name**.
2. **Add Course Timings**:
    - Specify **Tutorial** and **Lab** timings.
    - For non-lecture courses (e.g., MCP100, NLN100, etc.), add their **Lecture Timings** explicitly.
3. **Set Priority**:
    - Define a **priority order** for lectures, labs, tutorials, and other events as per your preferences.
4. **Add Events**:
    - Events can be added by inputting their **Instagram post content** directly into the system.
## **Shortcomings**
1. **No Automatic Updates for Dropped Courses**:
    - Dropped courses are not automatically updated. A feature to add images for such updates will be included in future versions.
2. **Undefined Timings for Lecture Courses**:
    - If a lecture course lacks well-defined timings, you must update them manually.
3. **Incomplete Instagram Post Information**:
    - If the Instagram post text does not include event timings:
        - The event will be added to a separate column with **TBA (To Be Announced)** timings.
        - A feature to add images for such cases will be introduced in upcoming updates.
